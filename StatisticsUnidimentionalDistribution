Here I provide several tasks from Statistics department about Unidimensional Distribution. 
The main purposes are to obtain and interpret the: 
•       Interval points
•	Relative Frequency
•	Cumulative Relative Frequency
•	Width of The Interval
•	Interval Midpoint (Class mark)
•	Density and Height (2 types of patterns)
•	Intervals scheme
•	Area of rectangle in Cumulative Grouped Variables Graph
•	Mode (2 types of patterns)
•	Mean: (2 types of patterns)
•	Median (2 types of patterns)
•	First Relative Frequency For Median
•	Quartiles (2 types of patterns)
•	Deciles (2 types of patterns)
•	Percentiles (2 types of patterns)
•	Range
•	Interquartile range
•	Variance (2 types of patterns)
•	Coefficient of Variation
•	Standard Deviation
•	Representativeness of the Mean (3 types of patterns)
•	*Total* value (salary, revenue, sales)
•	Effect in change of origin (Mode, Mean, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation)
•	Effect in change of scale (Mode, Mean, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation)
