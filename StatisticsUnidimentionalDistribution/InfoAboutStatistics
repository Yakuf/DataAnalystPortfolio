Here I upload several exercises from Statistic of Unidimensional Distribution Topic. 
In these files I extracted, calculated and interpreted following items:
•	Relative Frequency
•	Cumulative Relative Frequency
•	Width
•	Interval Midpoint (Classmark)
•	Density/Height (2 types of patterns)
•	Intervals scheme
•	Area of rectangle (in cumulative and grouped variables histogram)
•	Mode (2 types of patterns)
•	Mean (2 types of patterns)
•	Median (2 types of patterns)
•	First Relative Frequency For Median
•	Quartiles (2 types of patterns)
•	Deciles (2 types of patterns)
•	Percentiles (2 types of patterns)
•	Range
•	Interquartile range
•	Variance (2 types of patterns)
•	Coefficient of Variation
•	Standard Deviation
•	Representativeness of the mean (3 types of patterns)
•	“Total” value (salary, revenue, sales)
•	Effects in change of origin (Mode, Mean, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation)
•	Effects in change of scale (Mode, Mean, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation)
